1. C++ is statically typed language , type deduction must be known at Compile time
2. Curly braces express grouping in C++
3. #include includes the declaration for the library
4. If two functions can be called f(int, double) and f(double,int) compiler error
5. General initialization {} does not narrow conversions
6. If type names are quite long use auto
7. Name defined in function or lambda ends with {} block -> Local Scope
8. Namespace object point of destruction is end of program
9. The const may be computed at run time, constexpr is calculated at compile time
10. A constexpr function can take non const arguments
11. When we want a function to be called on compile time use consteval
12. In declarations [] means array of , size of array must be constant expression
13. prefix unary * mean contents of , & address of
14. suffix unary & mean reference to, a reference can't be changed after initialization
15. A reference must refer to a valid object
16. if(auto n = v.size()) gets in if n!=0
17.
